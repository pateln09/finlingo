## 🛰️ Overview

**FINLINGO** is a celestial-themed iOS app that turns **financial literacy** into a cosmic adventure.  
Users embark on a journey across the solar system — from **Mercury to Pluto** — learning financial skills, earning rewards, and tracking their progress as they explore each planet.

Built entirely with **SwiftUI**, FINLINGO blends education, gamification, and art into a smooth and engaging mobile experience.
